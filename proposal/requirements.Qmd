# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People

Nicholas Tierney and Eric Scott will do the coding work on this project.  Both have experience developing R packages and working with `targets` as well as some experience with geospatial analysis in R.  Additionally we plan to consult with geospatial experts who are more familiar with the "rough edges" related to doing geospatial analysis in R and with the `targets` package.

## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

We will adopt a code of conduct and contribution guideline based on guidelines used by rOpenSci.  Communication regarding development will happen primarily via GitHub issues, with additional communication not regarding code happening via the rOpenSci Slack where both Eric and Nicholas are members.  We may hold occasional video meetings as well.

## Funding

We request funding to pay for the time of the personnel working on this project.

- Eric Scott, xx hours totaling $xxxx
- Nicholas Tierney, xx hours totaling $xxxx

Additionally, we will consult with geospatial experts and would like to be able to pay them for their time:
