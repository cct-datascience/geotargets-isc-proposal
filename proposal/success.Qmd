# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->


## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

The geotargets project will be done when it can support fundamental geospatial raster and vector operations for the {terra} and {sf} packages. We will include examples of using these targets workflows for {terra} and {sf} in the form of vignettes, as well as link to existing repositories that will 

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->
We will use github issues to identify key tasks that require completing. For example, identifying target components for rasters and vectors for the terra package were outlined in https://github.com/njtierney/geotargets/issues/12. The pull requests that resolved this were linked in the issue.

Another way we will measure success is by community uptake - if the project is used by the community then we will know that the project is successful, because it means it is solving a real need for the people using it.

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?
