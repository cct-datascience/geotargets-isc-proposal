# The proposal
<!--
This is where the proposal should be outlined. 
-->

## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->

## Detail
<!--
Go into more detail about the specifics of the project and it delivers against the problem.

Depending on project type the detail section should include:

 - [ ] Minimum Viable Product
 - [ ] Architecture
 - [ ] Assumptions
-->

- Community feedback about features needed
- Identify shortcomings in existing packages that we could contribute to to make them work better with `targets` (e.g. gadm not returning filepath, so doesn't work with `tar_file()`).
- Package that integrates with terra and sf
- Filetype backend independent of pacakge somewhat with `filetype` argument
