# Project plan

## Start-up phase

<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->

We have already created a [repository](https://github.com/njtierney/geotargets) on GitHub that uses GitHub actions to run package checks.
In the start-up phase, we will focus on making design decisions about what the package will offer and research and discuss what r-spatial packages and object types will we support.
Answering these questions will lay the groundwork for efficient collaborative development of the package.

## Technical delivery

<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

Our goal is to deliver a package that allows users to use the `targets` package with various r-spatial packages (`terra`, `sf`, `stars`, etc.) with as little friction as possible.

Milestone 1: <date>

-   Basic package with functionality for `terra` `SpatRaster` and `SpatVector` objects
-   Well documented functions with high test coverage ensuring a solid start to the project
-   Creation of a `pkgdown` website for the package hosted on GitHub pages

Milestone 2: <date>

-   Add support for objects from a second r-spatial package such as `sf`
-   Benchmarking of various file type options for storing targets including file size and read and write speed. Our findings will be published as an article on the `geotargets` website.

Milestone 3: <date>

-   Add support for objects from a third r-spatial package.

## Other aspects

<!--
Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.

 - [ ] Announcement post
 - [ ] Delivery blog post
 - [ ] Twitter
 - [ ] UseR!
 - [ ] ISC meetings
-->

Throughout the project we will seek feedback from users on social media (Mastodon and Twitter) and on the `targets` discussion forum.
Each milestone will coincide roughly with a release on GitHub and a short blog post on <https://www.njtierney.com/>.
